summary: "On the surface, writing and coding seem totally different. But for me, they're two sides of the same creative spark."

Most people see writing and coding as opposites.

One’s creative, emotional, and messy. The other is logical, structured, and precise.

But for me, they’ve always gone together. I don’t choose between them — I chase both.

Because when I’m writing a story or building a program, I’m doing the same thing:  
**I’m building something from nothing.**

### ✍️ Writing: Making Meaning

I’ve been writing stories for as long as I can remember.

The Echoverse — my fictional universe — didn’t just appear fully formed. It started with half-finished characters, scattered lore, late-night ideas scribbled in notebooks. (Not even joking, the first thing I did for the Echoverse was scratch down a note about my character, Kael in the middle of night). Over time, it grew into worlds, timelines, and epics that span generations.

Writing gives me the space to wonder and wander. I get to explore “what ifs,” wrestle with identity, conflict, and purpose — and bring it all to life through characters who feel real (even if they live on space stations or wield ancient magic or become assassins).

There’s something magical (ba-dum-tss) about watching an idea evolve into an actual story.

### 💻 Coding: Building with Precision

On the flip side: I started coding when I was 8. Python pulled me in, and since then I’ve learned more languages and built everything from websites to full-on desktop apps.

One of my favorite projects? `mDirt` — a tool I made with PySide6 to help automate Minecraft datapack creation. It was part problem-solving challenge, part playground. And I loved every minute of it. (Well, *most* minutes of it.)

Coding scratches a different itch than writing. It’s satisfying in the same way as solving a puzzle — except you build the puzzle first, and then solve it.

### 🔁 Where They Intersect

Even though writing and coding use different tools, the mindset is surprisingly similar.

Both require:
- **Creativity** — to imagine new things
- **Structure** — to hold it all together (unless you are a pantser, of course)
- **Patience** — because nothing works right the first time. Ever.
- **Revision** — because everything gets better with iteration. I've rebuilt mDirt at least three times, and it's the same with novels

A well-written function and a well-written scene both tell a story — clearly, efficiently, with impact.

Sometimes I even plan stories like I plan programs: break the plot into pieces, debug the character arcs, and refactor the pacing.
Ok, maybe that was a joke, but you get the idea.

### ☕ Why I’ll Keep Doing Both

Some days, I write.  
Some days, I code.  
Most days, I drink coffee and try to do both.

Because I don’t think I need to pick one or the other. The balance of logic and imagination keeps me grounded and curious. And chasing both is what makes creating feel complete.

So whether I’m plotting the fall of an empire in a fantasy novel or writing functions that automate something cool — I’m building something that didn’t exist before.

And that? That’s the part I’ll never stop loving.

Oh, I code because it'll probably make me more money than writing. 😂
