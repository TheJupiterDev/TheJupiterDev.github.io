    <h1>Why I Code and Write</h1>
    <p class="date">April 25, 2025</p>

    <article class="blog-post">
      <p>Most people see writing and coding as opposites.</p>
      <p>One’s creative, emotional, and messy. The other is logical, structured, and precise.</p>
      <p>But for me, they’ve always gone together. I don’t choose between them — I chase both.</p>
      <p>Because whether I’m building a story or a script, I’m doing the same thing:<br><strong>I’m creating something from nothing.</strong></p>

      <h3>✍️ Writing with Meaning</h3>
      <p>I’ve been writing stories for as long as I can remember.</p>
      <p>The Echoverse — my fictional universe — didn’t just appear one day. It started with half-finished characters, scattered lore, and late-night scribbles in notebooks. (Not even joking — the first thing I ever wrote down for the Echoverse was a one-line note about Kael, in the dark, on a scrap of paper.)</p>
      <p>Over time, those pieces became worlds, timelines, and sagas — each one tied to the others. And while none of it’s finished yet, I love the process of watching raw ideas turn into living stories.</p>
      <p>Writing gives me the freedom to wonder, wander, and ask “what if?” What if this character broke the rules? What if this war happened again? What if magic had a cost?</p>
      <p>There’s something magical (pun fully intended) about turning a blank page into a place someone could get lost in.</p>

      <h3>💻 Coding with Precision</h3>
      <p>I started coding when I was 8 — Python was my love language.</p>
      <p>Since then I’ve played with other languages, built desktop apps, made websites, and created tools like <code>mDirt</code> — a PySide6-powered app that helps generate Minecraft datapacks. (It started as a practice project, but became something genuinely helpful. Funny how that happens.)</p>
      <p>Coding scratches a different itch than writing. It’s logical, structured, and satisfying in a way writing isn’t. Solving a bug that has been haunting you for hours is the most rewarding feeling one can get.</p>
      <p>And yes, sometimes it’s frustrating (especially when you see "Traceback, most recent call last" pop up on the console for the umpteenth time). But when it works — when you finally fix that thing — it feels great.</p>

      <h3>🔁 Where They Intersect</h3>
      <p>You’d think writing and coding would live on opposite sides of my brain — but honestly? They overlap more than people expect.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creativity</strong> — for dreaming up new solutions, or characters</li>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong> — to organize a story, or a function</li>
        <li><strong>Patience</strong> — because nothing ever works the first time (trust me)</li>
        <li><strong>Revision</strong> — writing needs editing; so does code</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’ve rebuilt <code>mDirt</code> at least three times. I’ve rewritten book plots just as often. Planning code and planning a novel aren’t that different: you break it into parts, debug when stuff breaks, and refactor the pacing.</p>
      <p>Okay, maybe I don’t <i>really</i> “debug” character arcs. But you get the idea.</p>

      <h3>☕ Why I’ll Keep Doing Both</h3>
      <p>Some days, I write.</p>
      <p>Some days, I code.</p>
      <p>Most days, I drink coffee and try to do both.</p>
      <p>And I love that balance — logic and creativity, structure and chaos. It keeps me grounded, curious, and always learning something new.</p>
      <p>So whether I’m writing a scene or a script, plotting a kingdom’s fall or a function’s return value — I’m doing the same thing: creating something that didn’t exist before.</p>
      <p>And honestly? That’s the part I’ll never stop loving.</p>
      <p>Oh — and coding will probably make me more money than writing. 😂</p>
