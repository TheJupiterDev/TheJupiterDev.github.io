    <h1>Why I Build Tools No One Asked For</h1>
    <p class="date">May 6, 2025</p>
  
    <article class="blog-post">
      <p>No one asked me to build <code>mDirt</code>.</p>
      <p>No one requested a Minecraft datapack generator powered by PySide6, with features I personally find useful and probably no one else even knows about.</p>
      <p>And that’s exactly why I built it.</p>
  
      <h3>🛠 The Joy of Scratching an Itch</h3>
      <p>Some tools are born out of user demand. Others are born because something in your brain says, “Wait — wouldn’t it be cool if…”</p>
      <p>I love those projects. The ones that solve a problem only I seem to have. The ones that don’t need approval, or market validation, or even a single user besides me.</p>
      <p>There’s no roadmap. No meetings. Just curiosity and a keyboard.</p>
  
      <h3>🌱 Building Just to Learn</h3>
      <p>Sometimes the project doesn’t go anywhere. Sometimes it *shouldn’t* go anywhere.</p>
      <p>I once built a command-line tool that converted markdown notes into a fictional-world database. I never used it beyond week one. But it taught me regex, file I/O, and how to clean up spaghetti code with modular thinking.</p>
      <p>Another time, I created a pixel-art grid generator in Python. For no reason. Just vibes. And I learned more about canvas rendering in two days than I had in months.</p>
      <p>The point wasn’t the product. It was the process.</p>
  
      <h3>💡 When Usefulness Sneaks Up on You</h3>
      <p>The funny part is: sometimes these solo tools actually end up helping people.</p>
      <p><code>mDirt</code> started as a personal challenge. Now it's a thing I update, polish, and occasionally share — because it turned out *someone else* had the same itch.</p>
      <p>I've had friends use stuff I built in a weekend, things I almost didn't finish, and tell me it saved them time. That’s always wild. Because it proves that making something for *yourself* first isn’t selfish — it’s sustainable.</p>
  
      <h3>🚫 Why I Don’t Wait for Permission</h3>
      <p>If I waited for someone to tell me what to build, I probably wouldn’t build anything at all.</p>
      <p>I make stuff no one asked for because that’s where my best ideas come from. That’s where I experiment, play, and occasionally surprise myself.</p>
      <p>When you stop chasing an audience and start chasing curiosity, you build with less fear and more fun.</p>
  
      <h3>☕ What I’ll Keep Making</h3>
      <p>Tools for fictional timelines? Sure.</p>
      <p>Apps that automate things only I care about? Absolutely.</p>
      <p>Weird hybrids of writing, coding, and worldbuilding logic puzzles? Sign me up.</p>
      <p>Because even if no one asks for it — even if no one else ever uses it — I’ll still make it.</p>
      <p>And honestly, that’s the point.</p>
