            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Why hello there! Iâ€™m Joel, an aspiring software engineer and author!</p>
            <p>I am 15 years old, and have been coding since I was 8. I like learning new languages & software, I even make my own sometimes.</p>
            <p>Most of my stories are set in one world, and everything I have planned links together, in some way. Nothing finished yet, though I hope to change that soon.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy drinking coffee, writing stories, and programming!</p>

            <h2>Worlds & Stories</h2>
            <h2>Dravonarh</h2>
            <p class="ltext">Dravonarh is the planet where multiple stories and series take place. The planet is earth-like, and their technology can be compared to medieval England, though in the future they will encounter rapid technological growth (planned for a future Space Opera).</p>
            <p class="ltext">There are two main continents on the planet, with various islands scattered about. The Echo of Honor Trilogy takes place on the Northern Hemisphere, on the continent of <b>Arthandla.</b> On Arthandla there are a few kingdoms, the largest of which is Deadburn. There are a couple magics there, but the only known one is called Veilbinding.</p>
            <p class="ltext">The continent on the Southern Hemisphere of Dravonarh is called <b>Deyleur</b>. The Cursed and the Crowned takes place here. Here, Pirates are common, and it is comparable to Vikings. There is a strong, but mostly unknown magic force on the continent, called Adons, and the only entrance to The Magical Realm on Dravonarh: The Nexus Point.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Kashiet</h2>
            <p class="ltext">Kashiet is the neighboring planet of Dravonarh, and is the world where at least one story takes place. This world is <u><b>not mine</b></u>, it belongs to my cousin, J.P.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Taurenor</h2>
            <p class="ltext">Taurenor is another planet, though it is from a seperate solar system then Dravonarh and Kashiet. Constantly ravished by strange, crimson storms, the natives have learned to create their cities in the skies, to avoid the constant floods on the ground, and they build them with large domes to protect against the storms.</p>
