                                breaks a deal. But when a shadowy noble hires him to assassinate the Emperor of
                                Lorthenor Edvin begins to realize this job is
                                unlike any he's ever taken before. Political tensions are rising. Old alliances are
                                breaking. And someone is watching his every move. Pushed to the edge, Edvin must decide
                                if he's just a weapon for hire - or something more. Because the deeper he goes, the more
                                he realizes that this isn't just another job. It's a war. </p>

                                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Protagonist, Assassin</p>
                                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Late 20s</p>
                                <p>Edvin is a merciless assassin forged by years under the brutal tutelage of Kelton
                                    Blaine. Once a starving street orphan, he was shaped into a weapon that lives only
                                    for contracts and the blood they spill. Outwardly cold and efficient, he carries
                                    deep scars from a life where survival always outweighed morality. His eyes sometimes
                                    flare crimson, a hint of the darker forces within him, though he resists believing
                                    it means anything more than madness. His struggle
                                    lies between remaining a blade for hire or finding redemption in a world that has
                                    never shown him mercy.</p>

                                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Edvin's mentor</p>
                                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Unknown</p>
                                <p>Kael is a Bloodweaver, a mysterious figure who consumes sentient blood to manipulate
                                    the Primal Rhythms of existence. To most, he appears as a phantom who slips through
                                    shadows and bends the laws of nature. His motives are rarely clear, though he has a
                                    tendency to nudge events forward as if he alone sees the wider song being played. He
                                    carries an otherworldly presence, sometimes speaking in riddles, sometimes with
                                    piercing clarity that suggests he knows far more than any mortal should. His
                                    interest in Edvin is both as a warning and as a test, pushing the assassin toward
                                    choices that could shape the fate of empires. Whether ally or manipulator, Kael
                                    remains a figure impossible to ignore.</p>

                                <p><strong>Age:</strong> 52</p>
                                <p>Duke Raymon is the shadow at the center of the Irae‚Äôs conspiracy, a noble whose
                                    ambition long ago eclipsed any sense of morality. Cunning, ruthless, and utterly
                                    convinced of his own destiny, he views human lives as pieces on a board to be moved
                                    or sacrificed as needed. Behind his schemes lies the mysterious benefactor across
                                    the sea, but Raymon himself is more than just a pawn-he is a man who thrives on
                                    power and the thrill of control. His voice carries the weight of authority, his
                                    anger sparks fear even in his closest allies, and his threats are rarely empty.
                                    Where others see chaos in bloodshed, Raymon sees opportunity, and he has no
                                    hesitation in wielding assassins, spies, or forbidden magics to bend the world
                                    toward his will. To Edvin, he is not only an employer but a looming reminder of the
                                    web of power and corruption he cannot escape, and perhaps the most dangerous enemy
                                    of all-because he believes wholeheartedly that the world belongs to him.</p>

                                <p>Known as the City of the Gods, Astural is a sprawling metropolis of towering stone
                                    buildings and glittering spires that seem to reach for the heavens. Built on sacred
                                    ground, it is both a center of faith and a hub of trade, where temples rise beside
                                    taverns and whispers of divine favor mix with mortal ambition. To outsiders, it
                                    feels eternal, as though the gods themselves laid its foundation, yet beneath its
                                    grandeur lie alleys of secrets, hidden guilds, and a constant struggle for power.

                                <p>The City of Kings rests within a vast valley, surrounded by sheer rock walls that
                                    serve as natural fortifications. At its heart stands the imperial palace, a massive
                                    fortress of stone and steel, teeming with guards and advisers devoted to the
                                    Emperor‚Äôs protection. Unlike Astural‚Äôs spiritual aura, Empalinor exudes authority
                                    and order-its streets are carefully laid, its soldiers disciplined, and its walls
                                    seemingly unbreakable. It is the seat of Lorthenor‚Äôs power, and thus the most
                                    coveted-and most dangerous-target in the known world.</p>

                                <p>Bloodweaving is the forbidden art of consuming sentient blood to tap into the Primal
                                    Rhythms, the underlying forces that bind the world together. Practitioners
                                    experience surges of strength, speed, or even stranger powers, but each vial carries
                                    a cost-the rhythm of the blood threatens to consume the weaver as much as they
                                    command it. The practice is shrouded in secrecy, dismissed by most as myth, yet
                                    those who wield it can bend the natural laws of body and spirit. To some it is
                                    power, to others corruption, but to all it is a reminder that blood itself carries
                                    more than just life.</p>

                                waited to kill one of the most powerful men in the Frenta Republic: The Grand Duke. He

                </blockquote>
                <p>As I have begun reading 2 Corinthians, this verse stuck with me. It shows us that we will suffer as
                    Christ did, but because of Christ's sacrifice, that suffering will not last forever for those who
                    have placed their faith in him.</p>
                <p>We have something to look forward to, even in the hard times. Especially in the hard times.</p>
