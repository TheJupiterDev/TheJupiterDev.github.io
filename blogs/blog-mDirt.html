            <h4>In this post, I explain how I made the mDirt app, and I discuss the good and the bad of the way I went about it.</h4>
            
            <br>

            <p>Originally I used the PyQt5 GUI framework for the UI, but eventually got fed up with its Styling & Pixmap quirks, so I eventually switched to PySide6 (both frameworks are built off of QT, but PySide6 had less annoying difficulties.) As of now, the code is a mess, and my variable & function names are garbage, but, it works! For example, the block system works by taking all of the inputs, putting them in a dictionary (Python's version of a hashmap), and then adding that dectionary as the value for an item in a larger dictionary. Actually, now that I think of it, nearly all of the stored data is stored in dictionaries. Then, when you click Generate, it does some very bad, very incomplete error checking, then uses your inputs in some very large boilerplate. The boilerplate is stored directly in the main Python file, rather than in a seperate pile (honestly, why did I think that was a good idea?). I use mostly string concatenation, because F strings where causing problems when I just wanted a normal curly brace in the text. It also supports importing and exporting of (*.mdrt) files, which are actually just JSON files with a fancy file extension. Like the rest of the project, there is no error checking at all when importing projects, so if it has any unexpected or incomplete data at all, the program will crash.</p>

            <p>However, I am in the process of rewriting the entire application. I am adding proper error handling, better file checking, etc. It is going well, and I hope to have it out in a week or two. Thanks for reading my rambling!</p>
